# Data-cleaning-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-MySQL

This project demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL on a layoffs dataset.

## Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed duplicates, standardized values, handled nulls, and dropped irrelevant columns.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Analyzed layoffs by company, industry, country, and year.
   - Included insights such as the total number of layoffs per company and trends over time.

## Files:
- `sql/cleaning.sql`: SQL queries for data cleaning.
- `sql/eda.sql`: SQL queries for exploratory analysis.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Import the dataset into MySQL.
3. Run `cleaning.sql` to clean the data.
4. Run `eda.sql` for analysis.
